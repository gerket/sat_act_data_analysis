# Project 1: Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference

For this project, I'm going to take a look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. Suppose that the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - seeks to improve the participation rate of its exams.

### Goals
- A Jupyter notebook that describes the data with visualizations & statistical analysis.

- A 5-7 minute non-technical presentation targeted to the hypothetical client that highlights your findings.

### Requirements

Your work must _at a minimum_:

- Describe the data
- Perform methods of exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Use Matplotlib to create visualizations
  - Use NumPy to explore distributions of individual variables and relationships among pairs of variables
- Display your cleaned Jupyter notebook on a personal static website.

### Dataset

For this project, there are two datasets:

- [Dataset: SAT Scores](./data/sat.csv)
- [Dataset: ACT Scores](./data/act.csv)

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.
